Downloading:

Clone the hg repository:
hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/mstange_themasta.com/tinderboxpushlog/ path/to/tbpl

Installing:

TBPL has a client-side and a server-side component. Running only the client-side component is really simple, because you can just make it refer to the server-side component that runs on tbpl.mozilla.org. In order to do that, open js/Config.js and change the baseURL to "http://tbpl.mozilla.org/". Then you can open index.html and it will just work (even from the local file system).

If you want a standalone instance of TBPL with your own server-side component, the requirements for your server are a little higher. Data is stored in a MongoDB database, which is accessed by both python (dataimport/import-buildbot-data.py) and PHP scripts. All in all, you need these things:

 - a webserver (e.g. Apache)
 - PHP 5.3
 - Python 2.6 or better
 - MongoDB (some recent version will do)
 - Mongo drivers for both PHP and Python (called MongoPHP and pymongo)

Then you can set everything up:

cd path/to/tbpl
# Create the folders "summaries" and "cache" in the tbpl directory and make them writable for all users:
mkdir cache summaries
chmod a+w cache summaries
# Create the file php/sheriff-password.php that stores the hidden builder change password:
echo "<?php define('SHERIFF_PASSWORD', 'thepassword');" > php/sheriff-password.php
# Start the MongoDB server if it's not running already, for example like this (in a different shell):
/path/to/bin/mongo -bind_ip 127.0.0.1
# Start the initial import (this will take a while):
python26 dataimport/import-buildbot-data.py -d 5 # 5 is the number of days to go back in time
# Install a cronjob that runs dataimport/import-buildbot-data.py every 5 minutes
echo "*/5 * * * * python26 /path/to/tbpl/datamiport/import-buildbot-data.py" >> /etc/crontab

I hope this works. If it doesn't, pester mstange or file a TBPL bug.

If yo want Tinderboxpushlog Robot to be able to comment in Bugzilla, you'll need to ask Ehsan for the tbplbot-password.php file and store it in the php folder. Alternatively you could create your own Bugzilla user, replace tbplbot@gmail.com in submitBugzillaComment.php with you user's email and add a tbplbot-password.php file that looks like this:
<?php define('TBPLBOT_PASSWORD', 'yourpassword'); ?>

If you have a question, just send me an email at mstange@themasta.com.
